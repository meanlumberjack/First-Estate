2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Activated plugin should appear in 'Tools' menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My text is not in the right place. How to fix it? =
It is possible that WordPress usually wraps that text with some HTML tags. In that case use one of HTML tags to surround your text, e.g. &lt;h1&gt;My text&lt;/h1&gt;, or other (a, p, h2, h3..  etc.)

= Plugin does not work after upgrading to new version. =
Try to clear browser's cache, and reload page.

= I see only blank page. What to do? =
If you want to deactivate plugin, but you can't access admin panel, turn off JavaScript in your browser and than log in admin and deactivate plugin (This works only for administrator). Try also to clear browser's cache. If this does not work, try to find javaScript error in browser's console and post it to plugin's support page.

= Admin menu buttons are changed in a wrong way =
Please use 'Reset Settings' button on Admin Menu page to reset menu configuration to defaults. Remember that you should postpone admin menu configuration to the very end of admin page customization, because, any changes made from other plugins to admin menu (e.g adding new button of plugin that is activated, or removing that button when plugin is deactivated) could corrupt admin menu configuration.

== Screenshots ==

1. Text in header or footer could be customized.
2. Login page top bar could be changer or removed. Custom login photo could be added.
3. Admin menu is completely customizable. You can rename or remove items in menu and submenu, or add brand new buttons with custom links.
